This is a list of tips for your very first day of CCA.
Firstly, before CCA, remember to eat an adequate amount of food as you will need a lot of energy for running around. A LOT. Do not eat too much as it may cause you to end up 
throwing up a whole ton of food and that is certainly not a first impression you want to give your seniors. Secondly, remember to refill your water bottle and bring a large water
bottle so you will be able to replenih your water supply after much running. However, remember to regulate the amount of water you drink before CCA as you do not want to miss 
out on the fun (or any important briefings that may cause you your life jkjk ) going to the toilet. Next, put on some sunblock before CCA especially if you have sensitive skin because
the weather in Singapore can be erratic at times and the sun can case some real painful sunburns. Also, be sure to be as loud as you can and CHEER during jihe because it can help
to boost not only team spirit but also keep you awake in the sleepy afternoon after a long day of lessons! Lastly, just remember to be yourself and don't be paiseh at any time
because your fellow sister Guides are here to help you out! Have fun and Jiayous!
